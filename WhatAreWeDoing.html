<h1>What are we doing?</h1>
<div id=formDiv>
  <br>Everybody's asking!
  <br><br>
  When you text someone in Facebook Messenger (you know... it's an app thing),
  you text, and they text back. Then you text - it's kind of like a conversation.
  <br><br>
  But, when they are typing, there is this icon thing - with three waving dots -
  that tells you they are typing. You know - that three dot thing.
  <br><br>
  When I ask people "What is that thing called?" - everyone thinks that have
  an answer. One person tried to convince me his answer was correct!
  <br><br>
  If it's part of our lives, there should be a name for it! It the old days, we
  would wait for someone to name it, and they would tell us what it is called.
  They would come up with some inoquous name... something dull... something nobody,
  anywhere would actually say!
  <br><br>
  Now we are taking control of our destiny, of our language, of our words! We can
  determine our own vocabulary! All you have to do is say what you think it should be,
  and vote on three possibilities!
  <br><br>
  And that's all there is! <a href="index.html">Good luck!</a>
