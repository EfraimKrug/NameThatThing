        All the magazines that did not even consider reporting on
        this contest... I can not believe it! I mean, ok, People - I'm
        certainly not big enough to be in People... or Playboy or Penthouse...
        <br><br>
        But what about news magaizines? Aren't they even a bit worried about
        the future of the Dots? THESE DOTS HAVE TO BE NAMED!
        <br><br>
        Upon my word, I say... These dots HAVE a future in America! They were
        born here. They are about as American as Baseball, Chevrolet, and Apple Pie.
        <br><br>
        And Fried Chicken.
        <br><br>
        And, and, and... all kinds of real American things. The stars and the stripes.
        Baseball. Take me out to the ball game. Soda. Beer. And corn. And potatoes.
        <br><br>
        And that's all there is! <a href="index.html">Good luck!</a>
