<p><strong><u>Entry Window</u></strong><strong>. </strong>The

<p><strong><u>Notification of Win</u></strong><strong>.</strong>
	Within ten (10) business days of a contest closing, NameThatThing
	will use an automated random drawing process, determined by
	NameThatThing, to draw a potential winner for that contest. &nbsp;A
	confirmation process, which may include a background check, will
	then take place to ensure the potential winner meets the legal
	standards required. &nbsp;The winner and, if applicable, his or her
	guest(s) agree to cooperate fully with NameThatThing in
	NameThatThing conducting any background check(s), which includes
	providing information requested by NameThatThing including, but not
	limited to, full legal names and addresses. If the prize of such
	contest includes meeting a celebrity, meeting a public figure, or
	attending a special event and any background check indicates, in
	NameThatThing's sole discretion, that the potential winner or the
	potential winner's guest(s) pose a danger to or may harm the
	reputation of any person or entity involved in the contest,
	NameThatThing may disqualify said winner and move on to the next
	randomly drawn potential winner. &nbsp;Pending a positive outcome of
	the confirmation process, a NameThatThing representative will notify
	the potential winner via email and/or phone. &nbsp;The potential
	winner must respond within the time period designated in the
	notification (or otherwise within five (5) days of such attempt at
	notification by NameThatThing if no time period is given in the
	notification), or NameThatThing may move on to another randomly
	drawn potential winner. &nbsp;Before confirming a potential winner
	as the winner, NameThatThing may require the potential winner to
	confirm their eligibility. Upon such confirmation, the potential
	winner and guest(s) must execute and return all required documents
	within the time frame specified by NameThatThing. &nbsp;If you do
	not execute and return all required documents within the time frame
	specified by NameThatThing, you will forfeit the prize and
	NameThatThing will move on to another randomly drawn potential
	winner.

<p style="border: none; padding: 0in">Travel companions are also
required to sign a liability/publicity release prior to issuance of

is the participant's responsibility to ensure compliance in all
respects with these Official Rules. NameThatThing reserves the right,
in its sole discretion, to disqualify any individual who tampers with

abuse, threaten or harass any other person. NameThatThing reserves

Majeure</em>.&nbsp;NameThatThing reserves the right, without prior
notice and at any time, to terminate a contest, in whole or in part,

impaired or corrupted or that fraud, breach of confidentiality, or
technical problems, failures or malfunctions have destroyed or
severely undermined the integrity and/or feasibility of the contest.
In the event NameThatThing is prevented from continuing with a

</strong>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Arbitration
Disclosure</em>.&nbsp; By participating in a contest, each
participant agrees that: (1) any claim, dispute, or controversy
(whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) such participant may have
against NameThatThing, its members, managers, officers, owners,
representatives and/or agents, arising out of, relating to, or
connected in any way with the contest, the awarding or redemption of
prizes, or the determination of the scope or applicability of this
agreement to arbitrate, will be resolved exclusively by final and
binding arbitration administered by American Arbitration Association
(&quot;AAA&quot;) and conducted before a sole arbitrator pursuant to
the applicable Rules and Procedures established by AAA (&quot;Rules
and Procedures&quot;); (2) this arbitration agreement is made
pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be
governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (&quot;FAA&quot;), 9 U.S.C.
Â§Â§ 1-16; (3) the arbitration shall be held at a location determined
by AAA pursuant to the Rules and Procedures (provided such location
is reasonably convenient for the participant), or at such other
location as may be mutually agreed by the participant and Sponsor;
(4) the arbitrator's decision shall be controlled by the terms and
conditions of these Official Rules and any of the other agreements
referenced herein that the participant may have entered into in
connection with the particular contest; (5) the arbitrator shall
apply Arkansas law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of
limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law;
(6) there shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a
class or representative basis as participant hereby waives the right
to assert claims in any class or representative action; arbitration
can thus decide only the participant's individual claims; the
arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or
parties who may be similarly situated; (7) to the extent permitted by
law, the arbitrator shall not have the power to award punitive,
incidental or consequential damages against the participant or
NameThatThing; (8) in the event that the administrative fees and
deposits that must be paid to initiate arbitration against Sponsor
exceed $125 USD for claims less than $10,000 or $375 for claims
greater than $10,000 but less than $75,000, and the participant is
unable (or not required under the applicable Rules and Procedures) to
pay any fees and deposits that exceed this amount, NameThatThing
agrees to pay them and/or forward them on the participant's behalf,
subject to ultimate allocation by the arbitrator. &nbsp;In addition,
if the participant is able to demonstrate that the costs of
arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of
litigation, NameThatThing will pay as much of the participant's
filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the
arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being
cost-prohibitive; and (9) with the exception of subpart (6) above, if
any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid,
unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and
Procedures established by AAA, then the balance of this arbitration
provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance
with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or
conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, subpart
(6) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the
entirety of this Arbitration Provision shall be null and void, and
neither Sponsor nor Participant shall be entitled to arbitrate their
dispute. For more information on AAA and/or AAA Rules and Procedures,
participants may visit the AAA Website at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.adr.org/">http://www.adr.org</a>.</p>
