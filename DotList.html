<h1>My friends, you have to know <br>how important this is!</h1>
<div id=formDiv>
  <br>
  I just did an extensive search on the web for named dots. And I was
  appalled. Yes, appalled my sweetest friends!
  <br><br>
  Can you even begin to imagine how many named dots there are? And these
  are dots I (and I bet you) have no connection to whatsoever!
  <br><br>
  Yellow Dots of Mystery. Twister Polka Dots. Dot vectors. Wendy Vecchi. Darling Dots.
  Ultimate Dots. Vinyl Black White. The Very Hungry Caterpillar Dots. Red Michael Miller Dots.
  Two Dots. Three Dots. Pop dots.Vinyl White and Red Polka dots. <b>Dipping Dots!?</b>. <i>(The horror.
  The horror. Those poor dots. I am crying. A lot. Like really.)</i>
  <br><br>
  Dots and Boxes.
  Connecting Dots. Colorful Dots. Brian's Dots. Dots by Astral. Quantum Dots. Ten Black Dots.
  Definitive Proof Polka Dots. Dot to dot. Changing Dots.Dots and Spots. Dark Spot Brightoning Dots.
  JJ And Little Dots. Dot Vector. Amazon Echo Dots. Dots and Co. Radial Dots Icon. Pattern of Color Dots.
  Halftone. Novel quantum dots. Red Dot Sights. Google Tests Colorful Dots. Carbon Dots. Grunge Dots.
  Removable Dots. Post-it Dots. Happy Dots. Weeping Dots.
  <br><br>
  As my guitar dots gently weep.
  <br><br>
  For the nameless, lost, deserted and unfound dots. For the sad, distraught, and forlorn dots.
  All the little lost dots. Sad. Very sad. I am very sad about these lost dots. And it would
  not be so bad if they were not so beautifully animated! THEY LOOK ALMOST HUMAN!
  <br><br>
  My friends. Now is the time, take a stand, help these poor innocent dots. These harmless,
  abondoned dots as they wiggle their way from screen to screen. Wherever a person has the audacity to
  send a message to their friend - there the dots may be found.
  <br><br>
  Alone. Alone. All all alone. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the dots did creak.<br>
  Alone. Alone. All all alone. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ne'er a dot to blink.
  <br><br>
  Feed the dots. Tuppence a bag. Tuppence, Tuppence, Tuppence a bag.<br>
  Feed the dots. That's what we cry.
  <br><br>
  And, to add insult to injury, there is candy called... of all things... D-O-T-S!
  <br><br>
  Please help these poor maltreated dots.
  <br><br>
  ONLY YOU CAN HELP DETERMINE THE NAME FOR THESE DOTS! <a href="index.html">Good luck!</a>
