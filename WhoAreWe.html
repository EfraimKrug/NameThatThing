<h1>What are we doing?</h1>
<div id=formDiv>
  <br>
  OK. So you're here and you want to know who I am!
  <br><br>
  I have been developing on the internet for about 20 years. Since 2001.
  <br><br>
  Never with success.
  <br><br>
  I have run kitchens - I opened a kitchen at MIT. That was fun.
  <br><br>
  I ran a cafeteria at a college compas in the Boston area. That was fun.
  <br><br>
  I taught high-school - computers, statistics and theater.
  <br><br>
  I worked in a shop that networked hotels for the internet. That was bizarre.
  <br><br>
  I worked at a bank - in computers. I worked at a shoe store - in computers.
  <br><br>
  I am almost 60. My wife of 29 years asked for a divorce when I was fired from
  my teaching position. Now I am broke and even though there are laws against
  age discrimination - I find that potential employers are saying "... you have
  too much exprience for this job..."
  <br><br>
  And that's all there is! <a href="index.html">Good luck!</a>
