<h1>What are we doing?</h1>

  <br>
  OK. So you're here and you want to know who I am!
  <br><br>
  I have been developing on the internet for about 20 years. Since 2001.
  <br><br>
  Never with success.
  <br><br>
  I have run kitchens - I opened a kitchen at MIT. That was fun.
  <br><br>
  And now, my friends, I am faced with a truly ominous problem. We all are.
  My friends, there are dots, ubiquitous dots, dots that wave, that keep us
  tied to an application - and these dots, these ominous, ubiquitous dots
  that run our lives..
  <br><br>
  THEY HAVE NO NAME! Nobody knows what to call them!
  <br><br>
  We have names for Traffic lights, and stop signs, and one way signs. We have
  names for conductors, and switches, and gadgets. We have even have names for
  things that run our lives in a more abstract way: storms, rain, clouds, sunshine.
  <br><br>
  Not to mention things that nudge us into action - like whining children, gold
  medals, perfect weather, and rotting walls. And boots. And dance shoes. And tights.
  We have names for so many things.
  <br><br>
  If we wait for the authorities, the dictionaries, the word controllers and
  the politicians to name our dots - my friends - I assure you we will be
  waiting for a long time.
  <br><br>
  And so we have taken matters into our own hands. We have started this
  contest - and this is YOUR chance to participate!
  <br><br>
  NOW! Grab the bull (notice, the bull has a name) by the horns, seize the day,
  take a stand, and do something you can forever be proud of!
  <br><br>
  YOU CAN DETERMINE THE NAME FOR THESE DOTS! <a href="index.html">Good luck!</a>
