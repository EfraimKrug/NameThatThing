  <br>First you enter your email and name suggestion. Then we email
  you a response - so that we can make sure it's a real email address.
  We will never use or sell your email address ever. Except to mail you
  the final results (and information on your winnings if appropriate).
  <br><br>
  When you click on the confirmation link in the email, you will come
  back to our website. You will be presented with a number of possible
  names for the dots, and you can vote on the three you like best.
  <br><br>
  In order complete your vote, you pay $1.00. That payment makes
  your entry eligible for winning, and completes your vote. If you do
  not pay the $1.00, your entry will be deleted.
  <br><br>
  When the contest is over, we will send email to <i>every</i> entry
  to tell you if you won or lost. If you lost, sorry.
  <br><br>
  On the other hand, if you won, you will receive money to your paypal
  account (attached to your email address). We highly recommend using
  paypal. If you have another way you would prefer to recieve the money,
  we will try to the best of our ability to accomodate you!
  <br><br>
  If you are the only person who suggested the winning name, you get
  all the winnings. If you are one of some number of people, we divide
  the winnings up between all the winners.
  <br><br>
  The last thing you should know is that if you want to put in another
  entry, you can... but that entry will again require a vote and a $1.00
  payment.
  <br><br>
  We will determine the winning entry as soon as we have more that 1,000,000
  (a million) people who care about the future of these dots, or December 22, 2019.
  Whichever comes first.
  <br><br>
  At that point, we will mail every entry email address a final chance to
  vote. We will count votes, and contact and pay the winner.
  <br><br>
  And that's all there is! <a href="index.html">Good luck!</a>
