          <p>like grass and lawn mower. Like flowers and scissors. Like a boat on water.</p>
          <p>Okay, let’s talk about the knife first. I worked with a really awesome chef once who was giving a cooking demonstration. He said to his guests, “There are two types of knives: sharp and dull, and I use sharp ones.”</p>
          <p>I am not as skilled as he is and it is true. For him every sharp knife is the same. For me? I need a chef’s knife. Other knives never seem to be what I need. And it does have to be sharp.</p>
          <p>Okay, so the way it works: I find counter space big enough to hold my cutting board. There should be some extra space on the left side (I’m right handed) to hold the food I am going to process – say a bag of potatoes. (And, I hear you all echo ‘a bag of potatoes.’)</p>
          <p>Under me, possibly between my legs, is the garbage can, and to my right is a container for the cut product. I’m set up and ready to go.</p>
          <p>So that means I am happy in a kitchen with a sharp chef’s knife, a cutting board, and…. well it’s true, a peeler is nice to have. But that’s it. You can throw away all the other knives, and fancy cutters and slicers and dicers and little knives… or put them away somewhere, like in a sealed box in the basement. Oh, and a couple side towels. Those are nice to have. One is under my cutting board, and one is over my shoulder.</p>
          <p>Remember, every time I put down the peeler and pick up the knife, I am wasting time – so I want to minimize my time and maximize my use of space. For me, I peel about 5 potatoes, then I dice them, then I scrape them into the container (maybe in water to keep them from turning brown) at my right, and I put 5 more onto the cutting board.</p>
          <p>I peel the potatoes right into the garbage under me. When I am finished, I immediately carry the knife and cutting board to the sink and rinse them off… ready to move on!</p>
