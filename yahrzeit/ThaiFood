Green Curry beef

Ingredients

    1 to 2 medium-size steaks
    1 can good-quality coconut milk
    Optional: 1/2 eggplant (cut into bite-size chunks)
    1 red bell pepper (cut into bite-size pieces)
    1/3 cup fresh Thai basil (or sweet basil)
    1/2 cup good-tasting chicken (or beef stock)
    For the Green Curry Paste:
    1 stalk of fresh lemongrass (minced, or 3 tablespoons frozen prepared lemongrass)
    1 to 3 green chilies (sliced)
    1 shallot (sliced, or 1/4 cup diced purple onion)
    4 to 5 cloves garlic
    1 thumb-size piece galangal (or ginger, sliced)
    1 cup fresh coriander/cilantro, (chopped, leaves & stems)
    1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
    1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
    1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper
    3 tablespoon fish sauce
    1 teaspoon shrimp paste (available by the jar at Asian food stores)
    1 teaspoon brown sugar
    1 tablespoon lime juice

Steps to Make It

    Place all 'Green Curry Paste' ingredients together in a food processor,
    blender, chopper, or pestle & mortar. Add up to 1/4 can of the coconut milk,
    enough to help blend ingredients (reserve the rest for later).

    Process (or pound) well to create an aromatic Thai green curry paste. If you
    don't have a food processor or chopper, try using a blender, or finely mince
    all ingredients by hand and stir together well.

    Heat a wok or deep frying pan over medium-high heat.

    Add 2 to 3 tablespoons oil and swirl around, then add the green curry paste.
    Stir-fry briefly to release the fragrance (1 minute), then add the beef.

    Stir-fry briefly to cover the meat in spices (1 to 2 minutes).

    Add the stock and bring to a boil. Stir and reduce heat to medium or medium-low.
    Simmer 6 to 10 minutes.

    Set aside 1/4 cup coconut milk, reserving it for use later (the thick cream
    is best). Add the rest of the coconut milk to the curry, plus the eggplant (if
    using).

    Stir everything together, cover, and simmer 7 to 8 minutes, or until eggplant
    is tender enough to pierce with a fork.

    Add the bell pepper. Cover and simmer 2 to 3 minutes, or until everything is
    well cooked.

    Remove from heat and gently stir in the 1/4 cup reserved coconut milk.
    Taste-test, adding more fish sauce if not salty or flavorful enough.

    Add more lime juice if too salty or sweet for your taste. Add more sugar if
    not sweet enough. More chili can also be added.

    Portion out the green curry onto serving plates or bowls.

    Sprinkle with a generous amount of fresh basil and serve with plenty of Thai
    jasmine-scented rice.

Mango & Sticky Rice
Ingredients

        1 1/2 cups glutinous (sweet) rice
        1 1/3 cups well-stirred canned unsweetened coconut milk
        1/3 cup plus 3 tablespoons sugar
        1/4 teaspoon salt
        1 tablespoon sesame seeds, toasted lightly
        1 large mango, peeled, pitted, and cut into thin slices (at least 24)

Preparation

        In a bowl wash rice well in several changes of cold water until water is
        clear. Soak rice in cold water to cover overnight.

        Drain rice well in a sieve. Set sieve over a large deep saucepan of simmering
        water (sieve should not touch water) and steam rice, covered with a kitchen
        towel and a lid, 30 to 40 minutes, or until tender (check water level in pan
        occasionally, adding more water if necessary).

        While rice is cooking, in a small saucepan bring 1 cup coconut milk to a boil
        with 1/3 cup sugar and salt, stirring until sugar is dissolved, and remove from heat.

        Keep mixture warm.

        Transfer cooked rice to a bowl and stir in coconut-milk mixture. Let rice stand,
        covered, 30 minutes, or until coconut-milk mixture is absorbed. Rice may be prepared
        up to this point 2 hours ahead and kept covered at room temperature.

        While rice is standing, in cleaned small pan slowly boil remaining 1/3 cup coconut
        milk with remaining 3 tablespoons sugar, stirring occasionally, 1 minute. Transfer
        sauce to a small bowl and chill until cool and thickened slightly.

        To serve, mold 1/4 cup servings of sticky rice on dessert plates. Drizzle desserts
        with sauce and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Divide mango slices among plates.
