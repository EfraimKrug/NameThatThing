</font><font color="#333333"><u><b>Arbitration</b></u></font><font color="#333333">.&nbsp;
By participating in the Promotion(s), using the Service and/or making
Donation(s) (each instance, a &quot;Use&quot;), you agree that: (1)
any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether in contract, tort, or
otherwise) you may have against NameThatThing, its members, managers,
employees, representatives and agents (collectively, the &quot;Promotion
Entities&quot;) arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way
with any Promotion, use of the Service or Donation, the awarding or
redemption of Prizes, or the determination of the scope or
applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, will be resolved
exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by American
Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) and conducted before a sole
arbitrator pursuant to the applicable Rules and Procedures
established by AAA (&quot;Rules and Procedures&quot;); (2) this
arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving
interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration
Act (&quot;FAA&quot;), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16; (3) the arbitration shall
be held at a location determined by AAA pursuant to the Rules and
Procedures (provided such location is reasonably convenient for such
user), or at such other location as may be mutually agreed by you and
appropriate Promotion Entities; (4) the arbitrator's decision shall
be controlled by the terms and conditions of these Official Rules and
any of the other agreements referenced herein that the Participant
may have entered into in connection with the Use; (5) the arbitrator
shall apply Arkansas law consistent with the FAA and applicable
statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege
recognized at law; (6) there shall be no authority for any claims to
be arbitrated on a class or representative basis as you and Promotion
Entities hereby waive the right to assert claims in any class or
representative action; arbitration can thus decide only your and/or
Promotion Entities' individual claims; the arbitrator may not
consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be
similarly situated; (7) to the extent permitted by law, the
arbitrator shall not have the power to award punitive, incidental or
consequential damages against you or Promotion Entities; (8) in the
event that the administrative fees and deposits that must be paid to
initiate arbitration against the Promotion Entities exceed $125 USD
for claims less than $10,000 or $375 for claims greater than $10,000
but less than $75,000, and you are unable (or not required under the
applicable Rules and Procedures) to pay any fees and deposits that
exceed this amount, NameThatThing agrees to pay them and/or forward
them on your behalf, subject to ultimate allocation by the
arbitrator. In addition, if you are able to demonstrate that the
costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of
litigation, NameThatThing will pay as much of your filing and hearing
fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems
necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive; and
(9) with the exception of subpart (6) above, if any part of this
Section 16 is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or
otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures established by AAA,
then the balance of this Section 16 shall remain in effect and shall
be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid,
unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained
herein. &nbsp;If, however, subpart (6) is found to be invalid,
unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Section 16 shall
be null and void, and neither you nor Promotion Entities shall be
entitled to arbitrate their dispute. For more information on AAA
and/or AAA Rules and Procedures, you may visit the AAA Website

This TOU cannot be modified or amended in any way except in a written
document issued in accordance with law by a duly authorized
representative of NameThatThing. &nbsp;The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this TOU shall not affect the

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If any of the provisions of this TOU is found to be invalid or

consistent with applicable laws to reflect, as nearly as possible,
the original intentions of the parties, and the remaining provisions
shall remain in full force and effect.</p>

Our failure to enforce any provision of this TOU shall in no way be
construed to be a present or future waiver of such provision, nor in
any way affect the right of any party to enforce each and every such
provision thereafter. The express waiver by NameThatThing of any
provision, condition or requirement of this TOU shall not constitute
a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision,
condition or requirement.</p>
