  <br>Next - we are going to send you an email to confirm your
  email address. All you have to do is click on the email, and
  you are confirmed. That's that.
  <br><br>
  When you click on the confirmation link, you will come back to
  our website. You will be presented with a number of possible
  names for the dots, and you can vote on the three you like best.
  <br><br>
  In order complete your vote, you pay $1.00. That payment makes
  your entry eligible for winning, and completes your vote.
  <br><br>
  When the contest is over, we will send email to <i>every</i> entry
  to tell you if you won or lost. If you lost, sorry.
  <br><br>
  On the other hand, if you won, you will receive money to your paypal
  account (attached to your email address). We highly recommend using
  paypal.
  <br><br>
  If you are the only person who suggested the winning name, you get
  all the winnings. If you are one of some number of people, we divide
  the winnings up between all the winners.
  <br><br>
  And that's all there is!
