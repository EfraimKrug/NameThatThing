        <br>Now you should have an email. Just open the email, and
        click on the link.
        <br><br>
        When you click on the confirmation link, you will come back to
        our website. You will be presented with a number of possible
        names for the dots, and you can vote on the three you like best.
        <br><br>
      <!--  In order complete your vote, you pay $1.00. That payment makes
        your entry eligible for winning, and completes your vote.
        <br><br> -->
        When the contest is over, we will send email to <i>every</i> entry
        to tell you if you won or lost. If you lost, sorry.
        <br><br>
        On the other hand, when you win, you will receive money to your paypal
        account (attached to your email address). We highly recommend using
        paypal.
        <br><br>
        If you are the only person who suggested the winning name, you get
        all the winnings. If you are one of some number of people, we divide
        the winnings up between all the winners.
        <br><br>
        And that's all there is!
